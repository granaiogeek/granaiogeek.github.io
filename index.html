<p>America! Almost everybody has a gun.</p>
<p>They haven't moved on from the Wild West era. Be out of town by sundown or shootout at high noon or lynching at midnight.</p>
<p>It's a Hollywood fantasy!</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to self-determination provided it does not harm or interfere with others.</p>
<p>I am myself the world.</p>
<p>We Humans are the universe waking up to itself.</p>
<p>We are centres with infinite radius and diameter.</p>
<p>The Whole is your Soul, Self, Being.</p>
<p>Humans are the universe attempting to understand itself.</p>
<p>There is no meditator.🧠</p>
