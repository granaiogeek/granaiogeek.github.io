<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages</p>
<p>America!</p>
<p>Almost everybody has a gun. They haven't moved on from the Wild West era. Be out of town by sundown or shootout at high noon or lynching at midnight.</p>
<p>It's a Hollywood fantasy!</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to self-determination provided it does not harm or interfere with others.</p>
I am myself the world.
We Humans are the universe waking up to itself.
We are centres with infinite radius and diameter.
The Whole is your Soul, Self, Being.
Humans are the universe attempting to understand itself. There is no meditator.ðŸ§
